# client-cpp
Client in language C++ for Apache IoTDB using CMake on Linux

# 0. Apache IoTDB:
* [Apache IoTDB website](http://iotdb.apache.org/)

* [Apache IoTDB github](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb)

# 1. Description of project structure
* SessionExample.cpp : the main function of the project, containing examples of the client methods to use IoTDB
* Session (folder) : Class Session which wrap the rpc interfaces generated by thrift
* gen-cpp (folder) : the cpp files generated by thrift from rpc.thrift and sync.thrift
* CMakeLists.txt (the one under project root directory) : the CMakeLists for the whole project
* build (folder) : the files generated by cmake while compiling and after compiled. The final executable file client-cpp is in it.
* libthrift.a, libthriftnb.a : thrift cpp static library

# 2. How to run
Under the project root directory, run commands:
```
cd build

cmake ..

make

./client-cpp
```

# 3. Possible improvements
If write a .sh or .bat shell file to make the progress automatically, then the gen-cpp folder is not needed.

The sript file can be coded following steps below:

step 1: Using thrift to compile rpc.thrift, get gen-cpp folder.

step 2: Delete TSIService_server.skeleton.cpp in gen-cpp folder

step 3: run command: cmake .. , make, ./client-cpp successively under the client-cpp/build

# 4. More info
## 4.1 Basic requirements
* thrift version: 0.13.0
* cmake: 3.16
* Apache IoTDB version: apache-iotdb-0.10.0
## 4.2 Others
* If you want to use your own thrift cpp library, just change the CMakeLists.txt.(that is to say, if you run this project on Windows system, you need change the thrift cpp static library to .lib library file)
